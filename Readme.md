⛔ DEPRECATED. The **Scaffolding Wizard** is not supported in v22.1+. Refer to the following article for more information: [Scaffolding Wizards (for WPF and WinForms) – The Past and the Future](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/wpf/archive/2022/01/27/scaffolding-wizards-the-past-and-the-future.aspx).

You can use the [Items Source Wizard](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/16553/whats-installed/items-source-wizard) instead to generate code for CRUD operations based on your data source.

The [WPF Template Gallery](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/16495/whats-installed/template-gallery) contains a set of popular application layouts of DevExpress Controls, which you can use in your application.

The current approach will not be updated in the future.
